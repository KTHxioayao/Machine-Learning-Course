# Assignment 9: Neural Networks

## Purpose
This assginement focuses on training and evaluating neural networks to model and predict the sine function using the `neuralnet` package in R. The assignment includes experiments with different activation functions, out-of-sample predictions, and an analysis of the behavior of neural networks when reversing the input-output relationship.

## Files
- `code.R`: Contains the implementation code.
